# Ignore some unavoidable flake8 warnings; we know this is against
# pycodestyle, but some of the existing codebase uses `I` variables,
# so specifically silence warnings about it in pre-defined files.
# In E741, the 'I', 'O', 'l' are ambiguous variable names.
# Our current implementation uses these variables through HTTP
# and the FastAPI form specification wants them named as such.
# In C901's case, our process_account_form function is way too
# complex for PEP (too many if statements). However, we need to
# process these anyways, and making it any more complex would
# just add confusion to the implementation.
